title: Explain what happens when `setState` is called in React
---

## TL;DR

When `setState` is called in React, it schedules an update to the component's state object. React then merges the new state with the current state and triggers a re-render of the component. This process is asynchronous, meaning the state change might not happen immediately. React batches multiple `setState` calls for performance optimization.

## What happens when `setState` is called in React

### State update scheduling

When `setState` is called, React schedules an update to the component's state. This means that the state change does not happen immediately. Instead, React marks the component as needing an update and will process the state change later.

```javascript
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
```

### Merging state

React merges the new state with the current state. The `setState` method performs a shallow merge, meaning it only updates the properties specified in the new state object and leaves the rest unchanged.

```javascript
this.setState({ name: 'John' });
// Only the 'name' property is updated, other state properties remain the same
```

### Re-rendering

After merging the state, React triggers a re-render of the component. The component's `render` method is called, and the virtual DOM is updated. React then compares the virtual DOM with the actual DOM and makes the necessary updates to the actual DOM.

### Asynchronous nature

The `setState` method is asynchronous. React batches multiple `setState` calls for performance optimization. This means that if you call `setState` multiple times in a row, React may combine them into a single update.

```javascript
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
// React may batch these updates into a single update
```

### Callback function

You can pass a callback function as the second argument to `setState`. This function will be called after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered.

```javascript
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }, () => {
  console.log('State updated and component re-rendered');
});
```
