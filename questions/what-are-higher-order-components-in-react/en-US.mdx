## TL;DR

Higher order components (HOCs) in React are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior. They are used to reuse component logic. For example, if you have a component `MyComponent`, you can create an HOC like this:

```javascript
const withExtraProps = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return (props) => <WrappedComponent {...props} extraProp="value" />;
};

const EnhancedComponent = withExtraProps(MyComponent);
```

## What are higher order components in React?

### Definition

Higher order components (HOCs) are functions in React that take a component as an argument and return a new component. The new component typically wraps the original component and adds additional props, state, or behavior. HOCs are a pattern for reusing component logic.

### Purpose

HOCs are used to:

- Share common functionality between components
- Abstract and reuse component logic
- Enhance components with additional props or state

### Example

Here is a simple example of an HOC that adds an `extraProp` to a wrapped component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

// Define the HOC
const withExtraProps = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return (props) => {
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} extraProp="value" />;
  };
};

// Define a component to be wrapped
const MyComponent = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.extraProp}</div>;
};

// Wrap the component using the HOC
const EnhancedComponent = withExtraProps(MyComponent);

// Use the enhanced component
const App = () => {
  return <EnhancedComponent />;
};

export default App;
```

In this example, `withExtraProps` is an HOC that adds an `extraProp` to `MyComponent`. The `EnhancedComponent` now has access to `extraProp`.

### Common use cases

- **Authentication**: Wrapping components to check if a user is authenticated before rendering.
- **Logging**: Adding logging functionality to components.
- **Theming**: Injecting theme-related props into components.
- **Data fetching**: Fetching data and passing it as props to components.

### Best practices

- **Do not mutate the original component**: Always return a new component.
- **Use HOCs sparingly**: Overusing HOCs can make the code harder to understand.
- **Name the HOC properly**: Use a descriptive name that indicates what the HOC does.

### Alternatives

- **Render props**: A pattern where a component uses a function as a prop to determine what to render.
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks can be used to share logic between functional components.
